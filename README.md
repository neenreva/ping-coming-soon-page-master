# Frontend Mentor - Ping coming soon page

![Design preview for the Ping coming soon page coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge. I used scss for the first time trying to gain some experience and finding out it makes life a little easier for styling. I really like that in sass and scss you can nest styles. In my mind I can keep track of the elements easier while styling. Variables are a little cleaner as well. Mixins are going to be a time saver especially in larger projects that use set styling rules. Overall I will continue to use scss going forward simply for the cross browser support it adds. This project in particular isn't the best example. In order for me to copy the layout I had to fiddle with padding and margins in elements rather than just setting up flex boxes with values like space-around.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

**To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.**

## The challenge

The challenge is to build out this Coming Soon page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to: 

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Submit their email address using an `input` field
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
	- The `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"Whoops! It looks like you forgot to add your email"*
	- The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Please provide a valid email address"*
